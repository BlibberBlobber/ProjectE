/* Problem 6:
 * The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
 * 385
 * The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
 * 3025
 * 
 * Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 - 385 = 2640.
 * 
 * Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
